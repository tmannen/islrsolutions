Scaled because as noted in the text, Assault dominates everything were the values not scaled.

####a)

```
pca <- prcomp(USArrests, scale=TRUE)
pve1 <- cumsum((pca$sdev^2)/sum(pca$sdev^2))
```

####b)


```
pca <- prcomp(USArrests, scale=TRUE)
scaled = scale(USArrests)
vars = colSums((scaled %*% pca$rotation)^2)
total.var = sum(scaled^2)
cumsum(vars/total.var)
```

As expected, same results (with some rounding errors)

####a)
```
hc.complete = hclust(dist(USArrests), method="complete")
```

####b)

```
cut = cutree(hc.complete, 3)
print(cut)
```

####c)

```
hc.complete.scaled = hclust(dist(scale(USArrests)), method="complete")
cut.scaled = cutree(hc.complete.scaled, 3)
print(cut.scaled)
print(cut)
```

####d)

The results look somewhat different. The variables should most likely be scaled as then each feature would be equally 'weighted'.
