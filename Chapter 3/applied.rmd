####b)

```
cor(subset(Auto, select=-name))
```

####c)

```
lmfit <- lm(mpg~.-name, data=Auto)
summary(lmfit)
```

i) Yes, mpg seems to be correlated negatively with weight and positively with year, origin and displacement.

ii) weight, year and origin and to a slightly lesser extent displacement.

iii) It suggests that as year gets larger so does mpg, so newer cars usually have better mpg.

####d)

```
plot(lmfit)
```

The fit seems to underestimate values consistently in the beginning, suggesting a nonlinear fit. There are several outliers mostly in the latter values. One value especially (number 14) has high leverage and medium residual and may skew the fit to a wrong place.

####e)

For example:

```
lm(mpg~year*weight)
```

10.

####a)
```
lm(formula = Sales ~ Price + Urban + US, data = Carseats)
```

####b)

Price is negatively correlated with Sales, as is US being positive (Yes value). Being Urban doesn't seem to affect price (?) as p-value is very high, so the null hypothesis of it not affecting price is most likely right.

####c)

(Without Urban as its p-value is too high)

y = 13.04 - 0.055*Price + 1.2US (US is 0 or 1)

####d)

Urban

```
lmfit <- lm(formula = Sales ~ Price + US, data = Carseats)

####a)

```
lmfit <- lm(y ~ 0 + x)
summary(lmfit)
```

The p-value is small and indicates that x:s coefficient is valid, and the null hypothesis of them not being correlated is not true.

####b)

```
lmfit2 <- lm(x ~ 0 + y)
summary(lmfit)
```

Same as above

####c)

They have the same t-statistic
